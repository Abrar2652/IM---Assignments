Big O notation is also termed as 'Asymptotic Analysis' that is a measurement of efficiency and tells us how relatively better an alogrithms performs than the other. 
* "O" refers to the order of the function or growth rate
* "n" refers to the size of the input array to be sorted

It appears from the visualization of the given logarithmic, linear, quadratic, cubic, and polynomial functions that logartihmic function is efficient relatively. In case of functions of n<sup>k<\sup> format, while n remaining constant if k increases then the time complexity also increases i.e. the efficiency decreases gradually. If k=0, then the function becomes of order 1, also known as constant-time function which is the most efficient algorithm. 
  
## Mathematical Examples of Runtime Analysis: 
The runtime of different algorithms differs with the input size n. Letâ€™s consider the mathematical example: 
  
  If n=7,
  
    log n = 0.845
  
    n = 7
  
    n<sup>2</sup> = 49
  
    n<sup>3</sup> = 343
  
    n<sup>4</sup> = 2401
